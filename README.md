## Description

This project implements a voice assistant that can recognize and respond to spoken commands regarding time, date, and basic interactions. It leverages speech recognition and text-to-speech technologies to create a hands-free user experience.

## Features

1. **Greetings:** Responds to "Hello" with a welcome message.
2. **Time:** Provides the current time when asked "What time is it?"
3. **Date:** Provides the current date when asked "What's the date today?"
4. **Quit:** Gracefully exits the program when asked to "Quit."



## Usage

1. Speak clearly into your microphone.
2. Use the supported commands:
   - **"Hello"** to greet the assistant.
   - **"What time is it?"** to get the current time.
   - **"What's the date today?"** to get the current date.
   - **"Quit"** to exit the program.

## Future Enhancements

- **Expand functionality:**
  - Add more commands (e.g., weather, news, music playback).
  - Integrate with other services (e.g., smart home devices).
- **Improve accuracy and robustness:**
  - Handle background noise and speech variations.
  - Implement error handling and recovery mechanisms.
- **Enhance user experience:**
  - Provide visual feedback (e.g., text prompts or animations).
  - Allow for customizable settings and preferences.
